# Drowsiness-Detection-System
Developed a real-time drowsiness detection system to alert drivers using a CNN model to classify eye states (open/closed) and OpenCV for face and eye detection. Triggered an alarm upon prolonged eye closure to prevent fatigue-related incidents.
In this project i have collected dataset from MRL eyedataset which is not annotated so we did all the data preprocessing at Drowsiness_detection file and model training in models file.
